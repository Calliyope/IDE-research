Pros:
- Seems to be a lot of customisation options.
- Widely known and used -- many recommendations online and from peers. 
- It's free.

Cons:
- Daunting when first opened. Looks like a lot to learn to work with.
- Seems to run a bit slowly/clunky (maybe thats my laptop).
- Not used as widely professionaly due to other paid services.
